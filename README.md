# ng2-hearthstone
An Angular 2 project exploring the Mashape Hearthstone API

Main reason for ng2-hearthstone is to have a reference project with the latest versions of Angular 2/Material 2. Also, I'm trying to get my feet wet with Webpack 2.

As to where this is going in regards to Hearthstone, nothing's written in stone yet. If you'd like to keep up with this project, I recommend checking out my blog at
